# Root-Numpy-Pandas
Root_numpy  pandas routine for machine learning
One of my major difficults was how to translate the informations present in the Root output from the Delphes detector simulation into a format that can be used by ML application.
In this case I'm using my simulation events from an EFT SM higgs interaction, the events consist in three differents channels, pp -> ZH, pp -> WH, and vector boson fussion(VBF) pp -> h j j
